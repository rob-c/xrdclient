"""Kerberos 5 encryption: the RFC 3961 framework and the AES enctypes.

Kerberos never uses a key directly. Every message is protected under keys
*derived* from the long-term or session key and a "key usage" number, so
that a ciphertext made for one purpose (an authenticator, say) can never be
replayed as another (a ticket). This module is that machinery for the four
enctypes a modern KDC issues:

* ``aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96`` (17) and ``aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96`` (18),
  RFC 3962: keys derived with the RFC 3961 ``DK`` function (n-fold and
  AES), integrity from a truncated HMAC-SHA1 over the plaintext.
* ``aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128`` (19) and ``aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192``
  (20), RFC 8009: keys derived with an SP 800-108 HMAC counter-mode KDF,
  integrity from a truncated HMAC-SHA2 over the ciphertext.

Both families encrypt a random 16-byte confounder followed by the message
with AES in CBC mode with ciphertext stealing (CBC-CS3), so a ciphertext is
exactly as long as its plaintext plus the confounder and the MAC.

DES, triple-DES, RC4 and Camellia are refused by :func:`get_enctype` with an
error that says why: the first three are deprecated by RFC 6649 and RFC 8429,
RC4 would need MD4 (which many ``hashlib`` builds no longer have), and a
KDC that issues Camellia only is rare enough not to justify the code.

Nothing here is a data path: a Kerberos exchange encrypts a few hundred
bytes, once per login, with the pure-Python AES next door.
